# About the project
This code was created to demonstrate a fully functional application 
built with Angular that interacts with an actual backend (Firebase)
including CRUD operations. I've gone to great lengths to
adhere to the Angular Styleguide & good practices.

#Functionality overview
This application is a simple system that enables you to store a product with its price and quantity.
Beyond that, it enables you to list all the products, delete one by one and edit them.
No authentication is required, just access to see a list of all products with all details.
The main page also contains a button to add a new product and a side navbar.

#Getting started
Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed globally. We use `npm` to manage 
the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use it. Then run `npm install` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

# ProductSystem

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
